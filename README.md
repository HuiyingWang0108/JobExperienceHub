# Job Experience Hub

## 🌟 Project Overview  
The **Job Experience Hub** is a platform designed to help job seekers, especially those with career gaps, find **insights on job roles**, **set career goals**, and **share experiences**. The goal is to provide a transparent view of different job roles to help users make informed career decisions.  

This project is also an **exploration** for testing my **UI/UX design** and **Software Development (SDE)** skills to determine which path I am more passionate about.
